# CS-211 Data Structures: Final Project
## AI Sorting and Visualization
## Made by Shay Konradsdottir over 14 hours.
To start, run "./build/AI Visual Representation.exe"
The "./AI Sorting" folder contains the solution and code for the AI sorter, which is already implemented in the "./AI Visual Representation" folder. "./AI Sorting Presentation.pptx" contains a presentation regarding this project.
When using the AI Visual Representation:
AI Save/Load - The current AI's string to copy, or a place to paste a previously made AI string. If pasting a string, press Load.
Difficulty - Sets the difficulty of the int array. Press the New Array button to commit the change.
The New AI button will generate a new AI to build off of.
The left panel shows the current best AI. The right panel shows a 'child' of it, with some random assortment of modifications. It will continue to make new 'children' until it's child beats it. Then, the left panel will become the better AI and the process repeats.
At the bottom you'll see metadata as it runs. Score is the value the educator gives it based on how successful it is at sorting the integers. Original is the original int array. Reply is what the AI is saying in return basd on it's code.

## Note: This is definitely not a bug-free build.
